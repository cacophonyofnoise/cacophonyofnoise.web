			Heya, you've stumbled across my website. I'm Cacophony, 
			and sometimes I write poetry, and sometimes I write other stuff. I was originally posting
			my work on Instagram (@a_cacophony_of_noise), but that's a dogshit way to publish text-based
			media, so I made this website to host it instead! Have a look around, you might
			see something you like, you might not. Either way, thanks for stopping by.
			<br>
			A lot of the poetry I write is unfinished, so you might come across multiple drafts of the same poem,
			or find ideas or phrases reused across poems as I look for the best place for them. I primarily write poetry
			for myself, so it doesn't necessarily get the final polishes that you would see if a professional poetry magazine.
			The idea behind sharing my work is simply to make the work I've already done availible to people who might enjoy reading it.

					<h4><i>title</i></h4>
					<h5>By Cacaphony, date</h5>
					<p>
						They'll tell you that humanity only knows how to take <br>
						To take until there is nothing left <br>
						And then keep taking <br>
						Never once giving back <br>
						<br>
						This may be true <br>
						But do not have the arrogance to believe <br>
						That we came up with this idea ourselves <br>
						But from where then did we learn it? <br>
						<br>
						We learned it form the Earth <br>
						The seas and skies <br>
						The rocks and the dirt <br>
						That reclaim everything <br>
						For the Earth takes all <br>
						<br>
						Whether we are buried or burned <br>
						Or left to rot for our sins. <br>
						From the poorest pauper <br>
						To the richest tyrant <br>
						The Earth takes us all <br>
						<br>
						The moss that claws into your driveway, <br>
						The cobwebs in the corner of your shed. <br>
						The leaves that gather on your windshield <br>
						The mold that worms into your office walls <br>
						<br>
						Everything is consumed by the Earth <br>
						Returning to ashes and to dust <br>
						<br>
						Our cities will crumble ...
					</p>
					<p class="notes">
						Great example of a poem I started and then ran out of thoughts on.
						Happens with most poems really, but it's much more apparent on this one. I really
						like the idea behind it, this sort of nihilistic optimism about the environment and 
						our place in it, but as a poem everything after the 4th stanza is a bit off. It would
						probably need a pretty significant structural overhaul (not to mention actually being)
						finished to bring it to a state where it would be a true self-contained expression. - C, ToP

					<h4><i>Love</i></h4>
					<h5>By Cacaphony, November 22nd, 2023</h5>
					<p>
						If you look up the entry for Love in the phonebook <br>
						It'll tell you that love is found <br>
						In the soft spaces between <br>
						A couple who are embraced <br>
						<br>
						Now that is not strictly wrong of course <br>
						Love is absolutely found there sometimes <br>
						In the kiss of two boys standing in the rain <br>
						Or the hug between a woman and her partner <br>
						<br>
						But many people look for love there <br>
						And do not find it <br>
						And other never even glance there <br>
						And they find it anyway <br>
						<br>
						In the gentle silence of a library <br>
						That embraces you like an old sweater <br>
						Or the woman who stops <br>
						To help the young man put in his first set of earrings <br>
						<br>
						It's found over dinners with your family <br>
						Even if it's not the one you were born with <br>
						Or late nights with friends <br>
						Playing games and chatting
					</p>
					<p class="notes">
						This a poem I'm surprised I haven't written earlier, because it's very
						meaningful to me. It's far from finished, it doesn't have a real ending, I think the 
						rhythm is non existent, and there's some wonky stuff here and there, especially the 4th
						stanza, but it has more heart to it than a lot of other poems I've written - C, ToP

					<p>
						I gaze out across the future <br>
						And see a panoramic view <br>
						Through a maze of mirrors <br>
						And of kaleidoscopic lives <br>
						<br>
						A thousand pricks of light <br>
						Scatter wild through my thoughts <br>
						Each one a twisted winding path <br>
						Each different and their own <br>
						<br>
						They call me soft and brightly <br>
						Each beckoning me down <br>
						I know I walk on ever forward <br>
						And pass most all them by
					</p>
					<p class="notes">
						I really like the idea behind this poem, but I think the execution
						is pretty rough. At some point maybe I'll take another pass at it, 
						but here it is as a draft - C, ToP

					<h5>By Cacaphony, circa October, 2023</h5>
					<p>
						The Carpenter did not work with wood <br>
						Most carpenters do, but not this one <br>
						In fact, this Carpenter lived a life <br>
						Devoid of any carpentry whatsoever. <br>
						They never learned to whittle sticks <br>
						Sitting on rough benches surrounded by trees. <br>
						Or how to build a table, <br>
						Surrounded by the sweet aroma of their father's shop. <br>
						No, this Carpenter never tried to make anyhting from wood. <br>
						<br>
						Now this is not a bad thing, necessarily. <br>
						Most people live their lives <br>
						And never make anything from wood. <br>
						There's a good chance you've never done it. <br>
						Most people don't mind this, <br>
						And you might not either. <br>
						But The Carpenter is not most people, <br>
						And they are not you. <br>
						<br>
						You see, they yearn for it. <br>
						They yearn to feel the grain of the wood under the hands <br>
						They yearn to smell the sawdust in the air <br>
						And to see the dull gleam of polished wood <br>
						Under their workshop lamp. <br>

						The joy of just existing <br>

					<p>
						When you've set fire your whole life <br>
						You forget how to build thing <br>
						Maybe you never knew how in the first place <br>
						And maybe you never will <br>
						<br>
						You never wanted to burn things <br>
						It's just that the timbers go up so easily <br>
						And for a time, you thought that the joy <br>
						Of seeing something crumble downwards upon itself <br>
						Was the same as seeing something rise <br>
						from the earth, fresh and waiting <br>
						<br>
						You thought that the friends who watched the flames with you<br>
						Sparks streaking towards a sky dyed orange <br>
						Didn't long to create, to start something new <br>
						To leave something, rather than to take <br>
						<br>
						But now you stand, and look back over a world <br>
						Charred black and filled with ash <br>
						And you look foward <br>
						Towards a world that does not want to burn <br>
						And realize that you do not want to burn it <br>
						<br>
						But you know that it is not so easy; <br>
						The world is never still, never calm. <br>
						And you know that we are not either. <br>
						The world is either burning towards ash <br>
						Or carving something new, rising in every direction. <br>
						And each of us does the same, working to <br>
						Shape a world we barely understand. <br>
						<br>
						You do not know if you can stop yourself from burning it <br>
						You catch yourself, flicking your lighter. <br>
						Looking for the driest tinder, the perfect book. <br>
						You see those who have spent their whole lives building <br>
						And know that each thing they built, <br>
						You've burned another just like. <br>
						<br>
						You are not sure you can still build <br>
						You are not sure that you can leave the <br>
						Flickering firelight that drew you in <br>
						So long ago, a choice you didn't realize you were making <br>
						To follow that will-o'-the-wisp into the dark <br>
						Perhaps this is the path you were always meant to walk <br>
						The only path you can walk <br>
						But you try anyway <br>
						<br>
						You try to emulate those who build. <br>
						Their movements are smooth and efficient, <br>
						While yours are clumsy and inaccurate. <br>
						The things you build come out not quite right <br>
						Angle that don't meet square <br>
						Edges that don't quite touch <br>
						Sometimes they look good enough <br>
						And you are able to convicne yourself <br>
						That you never burned as much as you did <br>
						Or that the fires you set long ago burned out <br>
						<br>
						But then you catch a whiff of smoke in the wind <br>
						The practiced motion of one who knows nothing but building <br>
						In the corner of your eye <br>
						And you know that those fires are not so far behind you <br>
						And that they're oh so easy to start lighting anew. <br>
						<br>
						When you've set fires your whole life <br>
						You forget how to build things <br>
						Maybe you never knew how in the first place <br>
						And maybe you never will.

						We conquered nature all for naught, <br>
						And built our cities full of rot. <br>
						We lied and said it's for the best, <br>
						And cut down trees with birds in nests. <br>
						We laced our poison through the seas <br>
						So we could make our shipping free. <br>
						We burned the forests down to ash <br>
						For cheaper food to save us cash. <br>
						We worked until the very end <br>
						To leave a corpse we could not mend. <br>
						We could not stop our boundless greed, <br>
						And left wounds that will ever bleed. <br>
						We tried to stop ourselves it's true, <br>

						The world cast in shadow <br>
						The laterns all burnt out <br>
						The politicians march to war <br>
						And hate filled men they shout <br>
						<br>
						The rich and the religious <br>
						Stoke hate and fear and death <br>
						They claim that they will spread the light <br>
						And lie with the same breath <br>
						<br>
						Everywhere the lights burn out <br>
						One by one by one <br>
						You try to carry your laterns high <br>
						But from black to darker grows the sky

						Looking up at the bright-dark moon <br>
						My inner peace that won't come soon <br>
						Winding road up the endless mount <br>
						Heat heavy and head spinning with doubt <br>
						Narrow bridge o'er the bottomless pit <br>
						Myself hollow and counterfeit <br>
						Drowning in the black inky sea <br>
						A fate reserved, deserved by me.

						The world through a stained glass mirror, <br>
						Rippled like the water on a pond <br>
						With a fistful of rocks thrown in. <br>
						Distored and twisted like clay. <br>
						<br>
						Peer in, and your reflection stares back. <br>
						Note quite you though, the features are off; <br>
						The eyes look the same, but they aren't. <br>
						The eyes of a stranger stare back. <br>
						<br>
						The stranger, you don't recognize him. <br>
						But he is you, he has to be. <br>
						He's your reflection after all. <br>
						Or are you merely his reflection? <br>
						<br>
						Everyone else, they see themselves <br>
						Gazing back from that damn window. <br>
						A welcoming, familiar <br>
						Face, the face that they should see there <br>
						<br>
						Are you looking in the wrong mirror? <br>
						Are you the wrong man, gazing at <br>
						A reflection who waits for someone <br>
						else to come and watch them, love them? <br>

						The sands fall ever downward <br>
						From a desert in the sky <br>
						To a desert in the floor <br>
						One swallowed by the other <br>
						Irrevocable, unstoppable <br>
						The sands fall ever downward <br>
						<br>
						The sands fall ever downward <br>
						Some ponder the times when one desert was full <br>
						Others the time it will be empty <br>
						And the other full <br>
						But it doesn't really matter <br>
						The sands fall ever downward <br>
						<br>
						The sands fall ever downward <br>
						Sometimes, sitting from afar <br>
						Or perhaps sitting too close <br>
						You forget to watch the falling sands, but they fall nonetheless <br>
						And soon you will realize how much has since you last looked <br>
						The sands fall ever downward

					<h5>By Cacaphony, circa spring, 2022</h5>
					<p>
						Ceaseless thoughts inside of my head <br>
						The ideas clear like silver glist'ning <br>
						As I lay eyes closed in my bed <br>
						Or sitting in class feigning list'ning <br>
						<br>
						In my head my thoughts are racing <br>
						Sprinting hard adren'line surging <br>
						Footfalls that pound heavy and pacing <br>
						Not a mar'thon with crowds urging <br>
						<br>
						More like a race against time&mdash;or a bear

					<h4><i>An Emotion</i></h4>
					<h5>By Cacaphony, February 26th, 2022</h5>
					<p>
						The urge to collapse <br>
						To and die <br>
						The urge to run <br>
						Fight, energy high <br>
						Balance or schism or both <br>
						<br>
						Stepping on a rusty nail <br>
						High up in a mountain vale <br>
						Abandoned cabin, peaceful lake <br>
						The sweet sharp pain that cuts the silence <br>
						<br>
						Flutter like a bird in a cage <br>
						Foward back left and right <br>
						Everywhere the bars close tight <br>
						Try and try and try again <br>
						Desperate hope for freedom to fly again <br>

					<p>
						Wallowing in this falling rain <br>
						Not the sharp pound of nails <br>
						Or the whimsical soar of birds wings <br>
						The steady beat of falling rain <br>
						The dull ache of a mostly gone pain <br>
						A stagnant pool, not rotten or purtrid <br>
						Just lifeless, unchanging <br>
						An office abandoned and covered in dust <br>
						A factory broken and flaking from rust

						The chaos of a perpetual war <br>

						A passenger on a captainless ship <br>
						Floating the river alone and adrift <br>
						I wander down passages rooms and halls <br>
						I work all the stations as crew crowd and all <br>
						I cook in the galley and dust in the cabins <br>
						Cooking and cleaning for no one who's there <br>
						I work without purpose <br>
						Merely playing a role <br>
						An actor on an empty stage <br>
						Facing out an empty theatre <br>

						In the maze of life <br>
						We've been given the map <br>

						The twisting tendril flames climb high <br>
						As the heat burns the words from the page <br>
						The blaze unmaking all the books <br>
						The fire reaching up for the sky <br>
						And the great library goes up in flames <br>
						Our knowledge it chars and it cooks <br>
						The roof it comes down with a boom and a crash <br>
						And all the remains is naught but ash
