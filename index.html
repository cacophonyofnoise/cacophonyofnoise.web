			Heya, you've stumbled across my website. I'm Cacophony, 
			and sometimes I write poetry, and sometimes I write other stuff. I was originally posting
			my work on Instagram (@a_cacophony_of_noise), but that's a dogshit way to publish text-based
			media, so I made this website to host it instead! Have a look around, you might
			see something you like, you might not. Either way, thanks for stopping by.
			<br>
			A lot of the poetry I write is unfinished, so you might come across multiple drafts of the same poem,
			or find ideas or phrases reused across poems as I look for the best place for them. I primarily write poetry
			for myself, so it doesn't necessarily get the final polishes that you would see in 'proper' poetry.
			The idea behind sharing my work is simply to make the work I've already done available to people who might enjoy reading it.

					<h4><i>The Prairie Grass</i></h4>
					<h5>By Cacaphony, October 16th, 2025</h5>
					<p>
						They mowed the prairie grass <br>
						Each morn I walked through <br>
						On my way to class <br>
						The grasshoppers and butterflies <br>
						<br>
						There wasn't enough parking, see <br>
						So I had to walk <br>
						'Long an old crankéd road <br>
						Through the prairie grass <br>
						<br>
						A brief clash of clarity <br>
						Twice a day. <br>
						From the rustling wind and crickets <br>
						In the prairie grass <br>
						<br>
						An island of calm <br>
						And a pocket of peace <br>
						Lost but not hidden <br>
						<br>
						In the tall waving prairie grass <br>
						That they came and clear cut.
					</p>
					<p class="notes">
						True story. While with hindsight I suspect they probably just cut it because of
						the coming winter, man it made me sad. - C, November 2025

					<p>
						Time will pass <br>
						You will die <br>
						You will be forgotten <br>
						<br>
						I know this <br>
						As I know the blood <br>
						Pumping through my veins <br>
						Or the sharp winter air <br>
						Biting at my lungs <br>
						<br>
						They are incontrovertible <br>
						As the rains that fall <br>
						In the spring <br>
						Or the leaves that turn <br>
						In the fall <br>
						<br>
						And yet <br>
						I fight the passing of time <br>
						Clinging to each day as a lifeboat <br>
						I fight to keep living <br>
						As a cornered animal in a cage <br>
						<br>
						But most of all <br>
						I fight to be remembered <br>
						A frenzied, ferocious rage <br>
						Carving myself into history <br>
						With my nails and blood <br>
						<br>
						Life is <br>
						But a candle against the gale <br>
						N'er seen against the rain <br>
						The dew drops on the morning grass <br>
						Swallowed by the coming sun.

					<h4><i>The Garbage Can Overflows</i></h4>
					<h5>By Cacaphony, August 23rd, 2025</h5>
					<p>
						The garbage can overflows
						&mdash;I should empty it, but I won't&mdash; <br>
						With the weight of my failings <br>
						And the paintings I could never make <br>
						And songs I could never play <br>
						&mdash;This is both wrong, and cruel I know&mdash; <br>
						To say that I could never make such <br>
						&mdash;"Everyone starts somewhere"&mdash; <br>
						If only I could bring myself to start <br>
						&mdash;"Practice makes perfect"&mdash; <br>
						And I'm unable to force myself to practice <br>
						And thus become perfect <br>
						&mdash;or move beyond idle flailings&mdash; <br>
						So instead, the garbage can fills more <br>
						Another story I did not write <br>
						&mdash;They fill the trash&mdash; <br>
						My chest is covered in scars <br>
						Accumulated over years of attempts <br>
						To let the art inside of me bleed into the world <br>
						&mdash;All unsuccessful, of course&mdash; <br>
						I can't bring myself to strike true <br>
						I can't force myself to stab deep <br>
						Another crumpled paper <br>
						I drop into the garbage <br>
						I make a note to empty it <br>
						&mdash;But I won't&mdash;
					</p>
					<p class="notes">
						This is a remarkably self-pitying poem, but perhaps highlights how poetry, or (ironically)
						art more broadly can serve as an emotional outlet, and as those of us who have partaken in therapy
						know, emotions can be true regardless of a so-called higher rational. - C, November 2025

					<h4><i>Untitled</i></h4>
					<h5>By Cacaphony, July 1st, 2025</h5>
					<p>
						When the first book was written, <br>
						A library was built alongside it. <br>
						To house the book not during its life, <br>
						But after its death. <br>
						<br>
						When the book was read for the final time, <br>
						It was placed in the library, <br>
						Where it sat quietly while it was slowly forgotten. <br>
						Passing to memory, to ashes, to dust. <br>
						<br>
						As the years went on, the library continued to fulfill <br>
						Its solemn purpose, holding a constant vigil for dead stories, <br>
						As more and more were written, and subsequently forgotten. <br>
						Filling the library shelf by shelf, aisle by aisle. <br>
						<br>
						Our stories outline us <br>
						&mdash; often, but not always <br>
						But they too, cannot live forever. <br>
						And each will die as surely as each of us. <br>
						<br>
						Even the stories that cling to life, years past their due <br>
						Are warped and twisted by the passage of time <br>
						The touch of translators, the thick glass of modernity. <br>
						Which must surely be a death of but a different king. <br>
						<br>
						While the collection dwarfs any other assembled, <br>
						It is not for us to browse. <br>
						Over is our time with those stories <br>
						And were it not, they wouldn't belong. <br>
						<br>
						Nor is their loss ours to mourn, <br>
						For it was us that forgot them, <br>
						Allowed the dust to build and memory to fade. <br>
						We are they that shelve the books at the forgotten library.
					</p>
					<p class="notes">
						A longer narrative style than I usually write. This is one of a handful of poems
						that explore the idea of lost or dying stories, a motif that continues to fascinate me.

						We've stretched ourselves with woe <br>
						Carrying incomprehensible tragedy <br>
						55,000 dead they say <br>
						With a gleeful gleam in their eye <br>
						Drunk on what they've accomplished <br>
						In orchestrating our hanging <br>
						Ambivalent &mdash; or perhaps unaware <br>
						To use choking for breath. <br>
						<br>
						They fill our ears with sweet despair <br>
						and occasionally hope <br>
						&emsp;Although he's been asked to look for other employment <br>
						They can't sell us hope afterall, <br>
						Cause we don't need to buy it <br>
						God gifted us all with a small fortune <br>
						But despair is artificial <br>
						&emsp;We make it from scratch <br>
						<br>
						At the end of an industrial arms race <br>
						Chasing cheaper prices <br>
						Higher quantities <br>

						Every morning when I walk to the coffeeshop <br>
						I cut past a pauper's graveyard <br>
						Long abandoned, long forgotten <br>
						Tucked behind a worn stone wall <br>
						With the paper under my arm <br>

						I sit down on what was once a bench <br>
						Settled into the shadow of a low grown tree <br>
						<br>
						The graves here are filled with the young <br>
						Not the children &mdash; they're up near the church <br>
						But the young men and women <br>
						Cut down in their prime <br>
						The students at schools, soldiers and workers <br>
						The family that died when the tenement burned <br>
						The people consumed by the weight of the world <br>
						With so much life left to live <br>
						<br>
						I sit and bear witness <br>
						To the beauty that shone oh-so-bright <br>
						Before vanishing, whisked back into blackness <br>
						Searing an afterflash into the fabric of this town <br>

						The small wooden case on the dresser <br>
						Velvet lining cradling the jagged pieces <br>

						The greatest tragedy of all <br>

						The greatest tragedy of all <br>
						Is that the human mind cannot hold <br>
						All the stars in the skies <br>
						Or shades of blue in the ocean <br>
						<br>
						I think that's why we believe in gods <br>
						That someone, something, somewhere <br>
						Must be able to conceive of the beauty <br>
						That fills the world like air in our lungs <br>
						<br>
						For if not, if it should go unnoticed <br>
						It must surely be pointless <br>
						Spent in waste on us <br>
						Who cannot appreciate it in full <br>
						<br>
						If we could we must surely go mad <br>
						With wonder and awe <br>
						The way a single speck of sand <br>
						Glitters in the sun <br>

						Another from the backlog. I wrote this laying on top of my car in the middle of the night, pulled
						off to the side of a gravel backroad in the middle of corn country. I wrote it while I watched the
						northern lights (or what I could see of them so far south), and gazed at the stars. I think it's the first
						of a string poems with more religious themes, broadly centered around our relationship with god.
						It should be noted I consider myself agnostic, and thus my contemplations of religion tend to the
						spiritual, rather than the orthodox. - C, August 2025

						If you look up the entry for Love in the phonebook, <br>

						In the soft embrace of a romantic couple: <br>
						It's they that it calls Lovers. <br>
						<br>
						Now that is not strictly wrong, of course. <br>
						Love is absolutely found there sometimes; <br>

						But while many people look for Love there <br>

						And they find it regardless. <br>
						<br>
						In the soft smile from a friend <br>
						Who knows you completely <br>
						Or the kind woman who stops <br>
						To help the young man with his first pair of earrings. <br>
						<br>
						It's found over dinners with your family, <br>

						Or late nights with friends, <br>

						They'll tell you that humanity only knows how to take, <br>
						To take until there is nothing left; <br>
						And then keep takin. <br>
						Never once giving back. <br>
						<br>
						This may be true. <br>
						But do not have the arrogance to believe <br>
						That we came up with this idea ourselves. <br>
						But from where then did we learn it? <br>
						<br>
						We learned it from the Earth. <br>
						The seas and skies, <br>
						The rocks and the dirt <br>
						That reclaim everything. <br>
						For the Earth takes all. <br>
						<br>
						Whether we are buried or burned, <br>
						Or left to rot for our sins. <br>
						From the poorest pauper <br>
						To the richest tyrant, <br>
						The Earth takes us all. <br>
						<br>
						The moss that claws into your driveway, <br>
						The cobwebs in the corner of your shed. <br>
						The leaves that gather on your windshield, <br>
						The mold that worms into your office walls. <br>
						<br>
						Everything is consumed by the Earth. <br>
						Returning to ashes and to dust. <br>

						Our cities will crumble ...

					<p class="notes">
						Great example of a poem I started and then ran out of thoughts on.
						Happens with most poems really, but it's much more apparent on this one. I really
						like the idea behind it, this sort of nihilistic optimism about the environment and 
						our place in it, but as a poem everything after the 4th stanza is a bit off. It would
						probably need a pretty significant structural overhaul (not to mention actually being
						finished) to bring it to a state where it would be a true self-contained expression. - C, ToP

						And for a time, you thought that the joy <br>

						Was the same as seeing something rise <br>
						from the earth, fresh and waiting <br>
						<br>
						You thought that the friends who watched the flames with you<br>
						Sparks streaking towards a sky dyed orange <br>
						Didn't long to create, to start something new <br>
						To leave something, rather than to take <br>
						<br>
						But now you stand, and look back over a world <br>
						Charred black and filled with ash <br>
						And you look foward <br>
						Towards a world that does not want to burn <br>
						And realize that you do not want to burn it <br>
						<br>
						But you know that it is not so easy; <br>
						The world is never still, never calm. <br>
						And you know that we are not either. <br>

						And each of us does the same, working to <br>

						You catch yourself, flicking your lighter. <br>
						Looking for the driest tinder, the perfect book. <br>
						You see those who have spent their whole lives building <br>
						And know that each thing they built, <br>
						You've burned another just like. <br>

						You are not sure you can still build <br>
						You are not sure that you can leave the <br>
						Flickering firelight that drew you in <br>
						So long ago, a choice you didn't realize you were making <br>
						To follow that will-o'-the-wisp into the dark <br>
						Perhaps this is the path you were always meant to walk <br>
						The only path you can walk <br>
						But you try anyway <br>
						<br>
						You try to emulate those who build. <br>
						Their movements are smooth and efficient, <br>
						While yours are clumsy and inaccurate. <br>
						The things you build come out not quite right <br>
						Angle that don't meet square <br>
						Edges that don't quite touch <br>
						Sometimes they look good enough <br>
						And you are able to convicne yourself <br>
						That you never burned as much as you did <br>
						Or that the fires you set long ago burned out <br>
						<br>
						But then you catch a whiff of smoke in the wind <br>
						The practiced motion of one who knows nothing but building <br>
						In the corner of your eye <br>
						And you know that those fires are not so far behind you <br>
						And that they're oh so easy to start lighting anew. <br>
						<br>
						When you've set fires your whole life <br>

						We all yearn for love like sailors <br>
						On the ocean yearn for land <br>
						When rations run low and water runs dry. <br>
						A yearn that comes from deep within, <br>
						From your bones and from your heart. <br>
						But against false hope we harden ourselves <br>
						Because we sail on an endless ocean <br>
						Built of our tears and sorrows. <br>
						One that we know has long drowned <br>
						the towns and the hope that we hunt <bt>

						Do you ever feel like an asteroid? <br>
						Floating in space without a place, <br>
						Carried by your momentum <br>
						From long, long, ago <br>
						<br>
						Chance brings you to earth; <br>
						You fly through the atmosphere, <br>
						Burning blinding bright <br>
						And making day from night. <br>
						<br>
						But as you shine you burn. <br>
						You begin to crack from the stress <br>
						And finally break, spinning into a million pieces <br>
						Each oof which burns to ash and dust <br>
						<br>
						And the night returns, the asteroid gone. <br>
						The people who stopped tog aze <br>
						Upon your momentary marvel, <br>
						Turn back to their lives, <br>
						The meteor already a fading memory

						Spinning, circling, tighter and tighter, <br>

						They won't resist the constant pull. <br>
						<br>
						What would it be like, you think, <br>

						Where they have focus and motivation, <br>
						Flying like a planet orbiting a sun, <br>
						You wander alone in the dark reaches of space <br>
						A slow, meandering path, <br>
						Going from nowhere to nowhere again. <br>
						No even orbiting the illusion of a star <br>
						Or following a lamp that isn't there. <br>
						<br>
						Why fly when there's nothing to visit? <br>
						No light shining in the cool evening air. <br>
						No sun to give life to the plants below. <br>
						You sit and wait to see your light. <br>
						You sit and wait to see you die. <br>

						You stand tall against the sea and the spray <br>
						Looking out as the revolving lighthouse lamp <br>
						Reveals the terrain of the e'er changing waves <br>
						One flash, one instant, that's all you get <br>
						And when the beam comes round again, it's changed. <br>
						Never the same, never predictable <br>
						Sometimes you see ships, heading towards the rocks <br>
						And when the beam comes round again, they're gone <br>
						You watch the rocks, cruel and jagged <br>
						Reaching for the sky, as if to drag heaven to hell <br>
						And when the beam comes round again, they're gone <br>
						Sometimes you see calm and placid sea <br>
						Water rippling gently in the summer breeze <br>
						And when the beam comes round again, it's gone <br>
						Replaced with waves that dwarf your tower <br>
						Your refuge against an ever changing world <br>
						In your meager shelter you cower, brace <br>
						But when the beam comes round again, they're gone <br>

						The world is cold and windy <br>
						And you're hunting for a fire, <br>
						Whose warmth you long ago forgot <br>
						In another life, another place. <br>
						Was it even you who felt that glow? <br>
						The warmth, the safety <br>
						The shelter from the storm? <br>
						The memory is an echo of a call. <br>
						Did you really sit beside the fire, <br>
						Hear the crack and pop of burning wood? <br>
						Does the fire even exist? <br>
						Or is it just a desperate wish <br>
						For something other than this cold.

						Do you too hear the screams of anguish <br>
						As the book of the world is ripped through its binding? <br>
						The sound is everything, and nothing <br>
						Incomprehensible, and all encompassing <br>
						It cuts through you like a hacksaw <br>
						And you feel your muscles tear and part <br>
						Like the calm before a storm though, <br>
						There's no pain, just silent horror <br>
						<br>
						The good doctor's eyes never leave yours <br>
						As the bone cutter etches deeper <br>
						The screams. Your screams. Our screams. <br>
						Does he not hear them? <br>
						Or does he not care? <br>
						And can you decide which is worse? <br>
						When you guardian angel turns against you, <br>
						What is left that will let you endure?
